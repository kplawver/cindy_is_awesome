  title: Take two on my favorite memories of Cindy...In the beginning there was tenth grade and I met Cindy at a math competition, that neither of us were competing at, but wanted the extra credit points for volunteering.  Was instantly charmed with her outgoing friendly, joking, high energy self.

  title: Had lots of fun in HighSchool, including trips to the river front parks for inspiration for drawing (She and her Art friends let me hang out even though I was more a computer geek, was ok with a pencil and pad at the time..), lost of stories I need to write down, but certainly a highlight was doing a double date with her for Junior prom.

  title: She was my best friend through out high school and college and not sure how I would have managed with out her.  We even worked together in the Campus Sound/Tech crew called SpinalTech.  Trips to Disney, helping with Art projects, comparing the merits of PCs vs Macs, always something to chat about on the phone or in person.

  title: And certainly one of the happiest moments in my life when I married my wife (also named Cindy), and Cindy was my best person at the wedding (and thank you Cindy for putting up with my NY relatives concept of a bachelor party).
