Visiting my family this weekend and chatting with my Mom about old times with Cindy.  My mom is a big crafts person and Cindy and her always enjoyed chatting about arts and crafts and showing each other projects.  While we were talking she brought out a piece of art Cindy had made that I had gotten for my mom.  It's a beautiful piece and thought I would share a little of Cindy's high school work.
