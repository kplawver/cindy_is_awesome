Well, I have a few of the typically silly photos to share but wanted to share this one instead. We don’t find many opportunities to dress up smart (and I promise you I did have a jacket on earlier and the top button done up!), but Simon and Natalie’s wedding was one of those times. I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many well-dressed geeks in one location. Of course, I didn’t know it then, but this would be the last time I saw Cindy. Her passing has made me realize just how many people - friends - that I have not seen in many years since I stopped going to quite so many web conferences. It’s so easy to fall out of touch with people face-to-face, and I really hope to make amends for that.
