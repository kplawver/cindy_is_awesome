  title: ... with this grand finale.
---

Late spring, 2008: I had the distinct privilege of working with Cindy Li on the Yahoo! Front Doors Network Services design/prototyping team. On June 1st the the word came down: every team on the second floor of Building A was given a small budget and encouraged to go completely nuts decorating their space.

So we made Super Mario Cube World (lots of photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/groups/742357@N24/pool/) and [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kentbrew/sets/72157605430937224)).

The day we opened up for public viewing, Cindy showed up with a big box of fondant icing and implements of destruction.  An amazing stream of Mario-themed cupcakes followed.
