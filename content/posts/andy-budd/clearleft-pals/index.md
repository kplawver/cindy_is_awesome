Cindy & Matt have always been good friends to the team at Clearleft. We first got to know her during our early trips to SXSW, where she became an honorary member of the Britpack. Holding court at the Hampton Inn and Suites, at Ms Jen's Cheese and Wine Parties, or at the Great British Booze-up. To our surprise and appreciation, she'd also fly over to Brighton to help volunteer at our new defunct dConstruct conference. So I thought I'd share a collection of pictures of  Cindy with various members of the CL crew.
