Cindy and I both studied graphic design at the University of Florida. I preceded her by a year or two. I knew of her at the time but I don't think we had met while in Gainesville.

Years later I was hired by AOL and knew that Cindy had been there for a few years so I looked her up and found out her desk was nearby. What I learned quickly about Cindy was that she had a huge heart and cared deeply for her friends. She would do anything for a close friend.

This photo was taken at SXSW in 2007. The photo features (left to right) myself, Cindy, and Bill Knightâ€”3 UF Graphic Design and AOL alums in Austin together. I'll miss you Cindy. May God bless you and your family.
