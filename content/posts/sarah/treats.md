Since other people have shared how they met Cindy… I’ll share that… I really don’t know how I met Cindy, and I sort of love that. We both worked at Yahoo SF, but in different teams and on different floors. Still, I somehow felt both drawn and welcome to hang out with her. I can’t remember when we first met, but I do remember sneaking down to the 6th floor for the treats she used to save for me when we had ‘Treat Tuesday’, which somehow was only served to half the office. :)
