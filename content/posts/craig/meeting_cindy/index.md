I don't recall a specific moment of meeting Cindy, but it was at SXSW2005 and we just found our circles overlapping. Then we kept seeing each other at other conferences, and once she moved to SF we started hanging out more. There's just this large vortex of friendship around Cindy and people get absorbed into it. Not my picture, but it's in my faves...
