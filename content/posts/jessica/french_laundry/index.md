The following year, we got to go to the French Laundry with Cindy and Matt and my brother and sister-in-law. Cindy drove us all out to Napa, where we visited a winery before heading to the restaurant. It was an epic, glorious, unforgettable meal, and it included a huge truffle in a fancy box that we all got to admire before it was sprinkled all over our food. We’ve had a *lot* of amazing meals with Cindy and Matt, but I don’t think any of them could top the French Laundry.
