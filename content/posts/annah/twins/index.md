Cindy and I had talked about visiting each other and meeting the otherâ€™s kids since Apollo was born. Between different coasts, overlapping pregnancies, losing my mom, me going back to work, then Cindy getting sick, it took four years before I went to see her last year. Then, Cindy and Matt came to visit us in NYC this past September a bit over a month ago.  Of course, my twins loved her. They both immediately took off their shirts to wear the new ones Uncle Matt and Auntie Cindy bought them.  Man...I miss her.
