I don’t remember how Cindy and I became friends. I never worked on any projects with Cindy during my times at AOL from 2002 to 2007. Cindy was at AOL from 1998 to 2007 in our Dulles, Virginia headquarter. She just seemed to pop into my cubicle one day with her dazzling smile out on a visit to our West Coast office. We just connected.

As a professional, Cindy is such a talented person. She had the most amazing portfolio. Her earlier portfolio she coded herself using Flash and I still remember the homepage had a hand drawn girl and pink cherry blossom falling down. She was not only a talented graphic and digital designer, she was a fearless creative. Photography, sewing, cooking, new softwares and technology, Cindy rolled up her sleeves and tackled everything head on. Cindy was a proud geek.

Over the years, we continually kept in touch. I remember Cindy visiting her then boyfriend Matt. I was living in England and she was so happy to show off her British man. Us three went to Piccadilly one night and ate gelato. I remember how in love she looked. Without even having to ask, I knew Matt was the one. He was even geekier than her.

Years later and she was happily married to Matt. She brought her firstborn son Apollo to England to visit her in-laws. I got to meet Apollo and see how proud she was to be a mum.

Over the years, we would have conversations about mummy hood, work and life. Our friendship never stopped because of distance.

Cindy was always planning and preparing for others. Her constant stream of photos of what she cooked (so jealous I was never around to eat anything!) to items she sewn for her boys (like who makes felt food that looks so good to eat!) and endless party decorating and costumes making for her Apollo and Orion (even Matt too!).

There wasn’t anything Cindy couldn’t do. She was loved by all. She was an inspiration.

I remember one time she came into my cubicle and said to me softly, “Helen, Philip has cancer and is in the hospital.” We both cried for our friend.

Dear Cindy we never got to say our good-byes and I am crying alone without you. However, I don’t need a good-bye from you as you will always be in my heart. Because of you I will be a better creative. Because of you, I will love my boys and husband deeper. Because of you, I will have the courage to face any of life challenges. Because of you, I will be grateful for the time I have. Thank you for being you. I love you and always will.

Matt, Apollo, Orion - please know that Cindy lives on in each of us. May her  love, strength and courage continues to inspire us to reach for the stars.

With love, Helen
(aka Htrandesign)
