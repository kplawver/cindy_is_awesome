I don't know what to say about Cindy. She was such a warm welcoming person and I always enjoyed working with her. She made capes! When we had a Flickr team outing to go curling, she made capes for our team. It was great in the blue and pink Flickr colors.

She was a rad person, and I am happy to have been able to say I met her.
