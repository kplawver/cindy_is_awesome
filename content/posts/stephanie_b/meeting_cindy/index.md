I met Cindy ages ago, in a galaxy far, far, away (Jacksonville, where we grew up). I don't remember how we met either (I assume it was school? My memory isn't the best), but we spent a lot of time together growing up. We spent a lot of time together on the bus and phone and living in fear of our Asian moms, as only teenagers can. :smile: We probably never would have guessed then that we would both be off living in major cities.

After high school, we saw each other when we could. My first husband and I visited her in DC for her birthday, which was only a few days away from my husband's. I gave her a highly inappropriate Swatch watch while I was out picking up a big box of crabs for the festivities. I remember her wanting everyone to try to fit as many cheese puffs in their mouths as they could. Something silly, of course.

We did an all girls trip to Seattle and Vancouver in October 2003 with a couple of her AOL(?) friends and had a blast, eating crabs, salmon and the best calamari I've ever had in Victoria. (Some trip pics to follow.)

When I think of Cindy, I am in awe of her creative talent. Literally by her ability to just create *anything* she put her mind to. It's a skill I've never had and it just seems like a super power! I still have no idea how she can make as many beautiful things as she does.

I also love Cindy's unwavering loyalty. I know that if I needed anything, Cindy would do whatever she could to help me as I would for her. I have always appreciated her honest opinion about any topic that I was wrestling with. Not too many people will be direct with you. I love the directness! :slightly_smiling_face:

Also, looking at all these fun moments that everyone has posted, I realize that Cindy is the right mix of serious and silly. I hadn't really thought about it in that way until now. I love you, Ching. You're like a sister to me and you will never be forgotten, by me or any of your friends.
