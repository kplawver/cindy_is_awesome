Cindy was a creative powerhouse. She packed an incredible amount of time, love and selflessness into everything she created and many of us witnessed this happen in our days working on design teams at CC1-AOL. You could tell just by looking in her pod that she was a delicious explosion of mayhem.
You always wanted to see what she would build, design, sew up, cook up, and eventually shake up with her small, but talented 5 foot frame. Her costumes were handmade mostly from the ground up. They were meticulously crafted to the near replica of the character she was re-creating. She was always getting us to dress up in wigs and costumes depending on the occasion. She could swing dance, and I mean really swing dance. I wish I still had the video she sent me of her swing dancing somewhere around VA. If anyone has videos of her swing dancing, please post? We shared the same birthday. I’ve never met anyone else in my life with the same birthday. She loved her family. She loved her “cute, sweet, little grandma” and I felt how much she cherished and missed her family. You could not ignore her energy or the way she invited you into it. I’m glad that our paths crossed and I will always remember her. You just don’t meet many people in your lifetime like Cindy Li.
