Last night I saw tweets from Eric and Jared about Cindy. Though I never knew Cindy directly, she was one of the first “names” I met at my first SXSW back in 2007. I saw her speak on a panel and later would see her (normally dancing) at some of the parties.

I always found she had something interesting to say, and had an impact on the way a lot of people made the web we have now.

My condolences to her family.
