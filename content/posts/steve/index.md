When I'd first started getting back into portraiture drawing, Cindy was kind enough to grant me full license to use her photography as source material and encouraged me in the craft. A query against the database that my portfolio sits on shows credit to her for ten of the pieces I produced in 2007. Her skill at capturing a personality with the camera was very influential on my own work, and I'll always remain grateful to her for allowing me to use her photos as references. I even did one of her.

I also found this photo from a holiday party we hosted at our house in 2007. I don't recall where the lips came from - I think she made them out of silly putty - but the photo made me smile.
